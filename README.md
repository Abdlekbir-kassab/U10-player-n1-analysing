# U10 Player N1 Performance Analysis

This project analyzes the performance of a U10 football (soccer) player using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to identify key performance indicators, track progress, and provide data-driven insights to support player development.

# Project Structure

- `U10 player1.csv`: Contains match/training data of the player (e.g., passes, shots, ball losses, recoveries).
- `_U10-player1-analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full analysis process and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage guide.

# Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Statistical analysis of player performance
- Visualizations (bar plots, line graphs, etc.)
- Performance summaries and interpretation
- Suggestions for player improvement

# Requirements

To run the notebook, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy

How to Use

1 Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Abdlekbir-kassab/U10-player-n1-analysing.git
cd U10-player-n1-analysing

2 Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook _U10-player1-analysis.ipynb

3 Run the notebook cells to explore the analysis.

Goal

The primary goal is to evaluate individual player performance based on actual data from training sessions or matches, helping coaches and players make better development decisions.
